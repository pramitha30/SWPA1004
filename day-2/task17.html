    <h2>A Quiet Night</h2>
    The stars are shining bright,<br>
    Lighting up the silent night.<br>
    A breeze whispers through the trees,<br>
    Singing soft and gentle pleas.<br>
    <br>
    Moonlight dances on the ground,<br>
    Where peace and calm are truly found.<br>
    In this moment, pure and still,<br>
    The world aligns with nature's will.
