        I recently started learning web development. <br>
        I began with HTML, which is used to structure web pages. <br>
        Next, I moved on to CSS for styling and layout.

    <p>
        Practicing daily has really helped me improve. <br>
        I build small projects to apply what I learn. <br>
        My goal is to become a full-stack web developer.
