The <i>italic</i> tag is used for visual styling, often to indicate a change in tone or a term in another language.  
In contrast, the <em>emphasized</em> tag has semantic meaning â€” it shows that the word should be emphasized when read, and it can also help screen readers stress the importance of the word.
